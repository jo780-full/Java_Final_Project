The Project we made is a bus reservation system. The raw materials we used to make this this project are Java Swing, MySQL database, etc.
The project’s Key features are :-
1)A login system
2)Bus ticket bookings and cancellations 
3)A complete bus booking 
4)Bus detail modifications (Only applicable for the admin)
5)Printing of a bus ticket

When the project is run, initially what will be displayed is a login page where a customer or an admin can login and a logout option is involved . Both the types of users have different features that can be accessed and the perspective of both the users are given below :-

Customer Login : Here once the customer logs in, they can book a bus provided they have the following details :-  1) Customer Name
			2) Date of Travel
			3) Source City
			4)Destination City
			5)Aadhar Number 
			6)Category
			7)Seat Number 
			8)Contact Number
Once all the details are filled in, the details are sent to the MySQL database and verified. Once the details are verified (for eg: Source and destination are not the same/Seat no is already booked) The seat is booked and the details of the booking are displayed on the platform itself. The users are also provided with a refund in case of a cancellation. The users are given another option to also print their tickets directly to a printer using the Print button provided.

Admin Login : Once the admin logs in , they can modify ANYTHING on the platform using the administrator privileges they get. The features they get access to are :-
			1)Adding Seats to a bus : Once the Admin User Clicks here, The admin user can add more seats to a bus provided they provide the details of Bus Number,Date of                                 travel,Source and Destination locations.
      2)Adding a new Bus to the record : Once the Admin User clicks here they will be provided with an option to Add a bus whilst providing its Bus Number .
			3)Removing a bus from from the record : Once The admin User Clicks here they shall be provided with the power to remove the bus of their choice by entering                                                 the bus number they want to remove.
			4)Adding / Removing Admin Users : Here the Admin can add/remove other admin users by entering their details in the respective Admin Name and Password sections                                         and by clicking the add/remove button. They also get a table where the details of the other admin users can be seen. 

We hope you like the project we’ve worked on as we do promise to bring out better versions of this in the near future!
